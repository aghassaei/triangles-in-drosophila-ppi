# triangles
final project


ask them if they want me to link the girhub into their things

# plan

make toy graph to answer question: how do i want to figure out what/how many triangles 
a given node is a part of

change percentages later

put in ascending order

1916 triangles in total

| Type | Total | Percentage |
| ---- | ----- | ---------- |
| pos/pos/pos | 5 | 0.2609603340292276 |
| pos/pos/neg | 39 | 2.035490605427975 |
| pos/neg/neg | 71 | 3.7056367432150314 |
| pos/pos/u | 77 | 4.018789144050104 |
| pos/u/u | 1174 | 61.27348643006263 |
| pos/neg/u | 550 | 28.70563674321503 |

there were 0 triangles of type neg_neg_neg_, which made up 0.0 of the triangles
there were 0 triangles of type neg_neg_u_, which made up 0.0 of the triangles
there were 0 triangles of type neg_u_u_, which made up 0.0 of the triangles
there were 0 triangles of type u_u_u_, which made up 0.0 of the triangles

make pi chart?


maybe want to do 3 different graphs

That is ok! Make sure you link to the original fly interactome GitHub url, and you can copy the tables of the GO terms from the NMII README.md file. Those are also public (from the Gene Ontology website)
