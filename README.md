# triangles
final project


ask them if they want me to link the girhub into their things

cite anna correctly on viz graph

# plan

make toy graph to answer question: how do i want to figure out what/how many triangles 
a given node is a part of

change percentages later

put in ascending order

1916 triangles in total

include thing in screenshots

| Type | Total | Percentage |
| ---- | ----- | ---------- |
| pos/pos/pos | 5 | 0.2609603340292276 |
| pos/pos/neg | 39 | 2.035490605427975 |
| pos/neg/neg | 71 | 3.7056367432150314 |
| pos/pos/u | 77 | 4.018789144050104 |
| pos/u/u | 1174 | 61.27348643006263 |
| pos/neg/u | 550 | 28.70563674321503 |


### add somme asserts for these, since there should never be any::

wasn't possible to have these since we needed at least 1 nmii (listed as a positive)
there were 0 triangles of type neg_neg_neg_, which made up 0.0 of the triangles
there were 0 triangles of type neg_neg_u_, which made up 0.0 of the triangles
there were 0 triangles of type neg_u_u_, which made up 0.0 of the triangles
there were 0 triangles of type u_u_u_, which made up 0.0 of the triangles








different types of triangles

pos/pos/pos
pos/pos/neg
pos/pos/u
pos/neg/pos
pos/neg/neg
pos/neg/u
pos/u/pos
pos/u/ne
pos/u/u
neg/pos/neg
neg/pos/u
neg/neg/neg
neg/neg/u
neg/u/pos
neg/u/ng
neg/u/u
u/pos/neg
u/pos/u
u/neg/neg
u/neg/u
u/u/u

make pi chart?


maybe want to do 3 different graphs

### Citations

That is ok! Make sure you link to the original fly interactome GitHub url, and you can copy the tables of the GO terms from the NMII README.md file. Those are also public (from the Gene Ontology website)

example, get fly interactome, possibly ingrids pruning
